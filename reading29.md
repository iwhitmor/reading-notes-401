# Azure Blob Storage

## [Intro to Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)

* Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data

* Blob storage is designed for:

  * Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
  
  * Storing files for distributed access.
  
  * Streaming video and audio.
  
  * Writing to log files.
  
  * Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
  
  * Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

* Storage Accounts

  * A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account

* Containers

  * A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs
