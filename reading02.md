# Unit Testing and Documentation

## [You Still Donâ€™t Know How to Do Unit Testing (and Your Secret is Safe with Me)](https://stackify.com/unit-testing-basics-best-practices/)

* What is unit testing?

> Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of code. In C# you can think of a unit as a method. You write a unit test by writing something that tests a method.

* Unit testing best practices

  * Arrange, Act, Assert

  * One Asser per test method

  * Avoid test interdependence

  * Keep it short, sweet, and visible

  * Recognize test setup pain as a smell

  * Add them to the build


## [Are of README](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme)

* Etymology

> Dates back to at least the 1970's, but possibly before. The pattern of README in all-caps is consisten throughout history. Unix systems would sort capitals before lower case letters, which put README before the rest of the content. TLDR: README is importmant information for the user to read before proceeding.

* For creators, for consumers

> READMEs are important for everyone: creators, builders, consumers, etc. They are important and README lessons apply equally well to other programming ecosystems.

* The README

> It is what the consumer first sees when they look at your creation. Its job it to tell the consumer what it is they are looking at, show them what it looks like, show them how to use it, and tell them anything they need to know that is relevant.
> The ideal README is as short as it can be with detailed documentation that is consise and tells the consumer exactly what it needs, and no more.
> No README means the consumer and developers will have to look into your code in order to understand what it is. They should infact be able to use your README to figure out what it is you created without ever having to look at your code.

* Key elements of the README

  * Name

    * Who made it

  * One-Liner

    * One-liner that describes the module

  * Usage

    * What does the module look like in action

  * API

    * Should detail the module's objects and functions, signatures, return types, callbacks, and events

  * Installation

    * Include any nonstandard installation notes

  * License
