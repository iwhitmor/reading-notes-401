# JAM Stack

## [What is JAM Stack?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-jamstack-and-how-do-i-host-my-website-on-it/)

* What is JAM Stack?

  * A software architecture and philosophy that adheres to the following components:

    * Javascript

    * APIs

    * Markup

* What makes up the JAM Stack?

  * Typically comprised of 3 components: Javascript, APIs, and Markup. Its history stems from growing the term "static site" into something more meaningful (and marketable). So while ultimately a static site is the end result, it's blown up to include first class tooling for every step of the way

  * Javascript

    * The component that’s probably done the most work to popularize the JAMstack is Javascript. Our favorite browser language allows us to provide all of the dynamic and interactive bits that we might not have if we’re serving plain HTML without it.

    * This is where a lot of times you’ll see UI frameworks like React, Vue, and newcomers like Svelte come into play
  
    * They make building apps simpler and more organized by providing component APIs and tooling that compile down to a simple HTML file (or a bunch of them

  * APIs

    * Utilizing the strengths of APIs is core to how you make a JAMstack app dynamic. Whether it’s authentication or search, your application will use Javascript to make an HTTP request to another provider which will ultimately enhance the experience in one form or another
  
  * Markup

    * This is the critical piece. Whether it’s your hand written HTML or the code that compiles down to the HTML, it's the first part you’re serving to the client. This is kind of a de facto piece of any website, but how you serve it is the most important piece

    * To be considered a JAMstack app, the HTML needs to be served statically, which basically means not being dynamically rendered from a server

* What makes JAM Stack so great?

  * Speed

  * Cost

  * Scalability

  * Maintenance

  * Security
