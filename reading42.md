## [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

* This article makes a good point about being careful what you put out for code, even if you are following the directions of a big company. The author talks about how he followed all the rules/directions he was asked to do, but in the end there were issues with what he put out in his code. It wasn't his fault at the time it went to production, but the after affects were pretty bad and it still haunts him to this day

* It makes sense as to why he did what he was asked to do, and it also makes sense he feels how he does not. I'm sure in the future we will all encounter times that are on the line of right/wrong, and we will have difficult decisions to make

## [Self driving car ethics](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

* This article is very interesting because it talks about self-driving cars and who's fault it is if they are in a serious accident. Just from reading this article you get the feeling that this topic is something that is hard for people to talk about, and also pick a side on. It is something that will probably be talked about forever because in the future there will be more and more self-driving vehicles

* The topic of this article is something that I have really never thought that hard about, but after reading the article it has me thinking about it
