## [How to read technical documentation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140730081025-316694350-how-to-read-technical-docs-in-the-minimum-time-possible/)

* 1. Establish why you are reading it

  * You want to establish why you are reading it so you can find what you need to find. If you don't know what you are trying to find you  might not pay much attention to it

* 2. Get an overview of the content and structure of the document

  * Make sure to read the cover, table of contents, and any intro chapter

* 3. Take 30 seconds - 2 minutes to skim rest of the doc

  * Look for things that are familiar to you (pictures etc)

* 4. If you want, stop at the interesting parts and take a deeper look. Stop when it gets boring

* 5. Look at the table of contents again. You'll have a deeper understanding of the document after you look again

* 6. Choose what to read next based on interesting-ness or usefulness. If there's nothing useful, close the doc. You can say that you've read it from cover to cover
